# lein-azkaban

A Leiningen plugin to do many wonderful things.

## Usage

Add a key called `:azkaban` to your project.clj containing the following keys:

* `:endpoint` - the location of the azkaban management server
* `:project` - the name of the project in azkaban
* `:username` - the username to authenticate to azkaban as
* `:password` - the password to authenticate to azkaban with

```clojure
{:azkaban {
    :endpoint "http://localhost:8081"
    :project "my-project"
    :username "myuser"
    :password "mypass"
    }}
```
Currently the only supported command is `lein azkaban upload <file>` where `<file>` is a path to your project zip archive.

FIXME: Use this for user-level plugins:

Put `[lein-azkaban "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your
`:user` profile, or if you are on Leiningen 1.x do `lein plugin install
lein-azkaban 0.1.0-SNAPSHOT`.

FIXME: Use this for project-level plugins:

Put `[lein-azkaban "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your project.clj.

FIXME: and add an example usage that actually makes sense:

    $ lein azkaban
